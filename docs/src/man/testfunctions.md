# Optimisation test functions

EvoLP includes some test functions to benchmark your algorithms.
Unless otherwise specified, every function is of the form ``f(x)``.

## Pseudo boolean functions

onemax
leadingones
jumpk
```

## Continuous functions

Continuous functions implementations were taken from [Kochenderfer, M.J. and Wheeler, T.A. (2019)](https://algorithmsbook.com/optimization/). Most of these can be visualised in [Surjanovic, S. & Bingham, D. (2013)](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/optimization.html).
