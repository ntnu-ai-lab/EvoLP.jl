# Quick start

EvoLP was designed as a _playground_, where each _block_ is a reusable computation pattern that you can use to quickly set up your own algorithms and workflows.

You can find some useful tutorials in the navigation bar. These examples are also available in [the repository](https://github.com/ntnu-ai-lab/EvoLP/tree/master/examples) as Jupyter Notebooks.
The tutorial on [the 8 queens problem](../tuto/8_queens.md) details how to incorporate a custom algorithm into the workflow.
If you want to use custom blocks, you can [do that too](../man/extending.md).

## Installation Guide

### Install Julia

EvoLP is a package for [Julia](https://julialang.org). To use EvoLP, [download and install](https://julialang.org/downloads/) the latest version of Julia first.

### Install EvoLP

You can install EvoLP from the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) using the built-in package manager:

```julia
julia> import Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("EvoLP")
```

Alternatively, you can enter `Pkg` mode by pressing the `]` key and then add EvoLP like so:

```julia
] # upon typing ], the prompt changes (in place) to: pkg>
add EvoLP
```

Once EvoLP is installed, you can use all the building blocks by importing/using it at the top of your code:

```julia
using EvoLP

# your code here
```

## The general workflow

A common workflow in EvoLP is somewhat similar to this:

1. Use a [generator](generators.md) for initialising your population.
2. Code your objective or use a [test benchmark function](testfunctions.md).
3. Depending on your objective function and individual representation, choose appropriate [selectors](selection.md), [recombinators](cross.md) and [mutators](mutation.md).
4. Use a [built-in algorithm](algorithms.md) or code your own. Roughly:
    - Evaluate your population.
    - Use [`select`](@ref) and [`cross`](@ref) to generate new solutions.
    - Stochastically alter new solutions using [`mutate`](@ref).
    - Evaluate the new population members and select the survivors.
    - Optionally compute statistic and log them in the [Logbook](logbook.md).
    - Return the [results](results.md).
