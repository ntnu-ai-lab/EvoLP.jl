# Parent selection operators
# ==========================
# All selectors perform a single operation, as in a steady-state GA.
# Each selector returns a list of two indices.
# An array of fitnesses `y` is passed as a parameter and is used to obtain a pair of
# parents' indices (to be sliced from the population later in your algorithms)
